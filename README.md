## My Thoughts Leo Fu
I really enjoyed this article because it explains the broader concept of software engineering.  
What stood out to me is how software engineering is not only about coding, but also about teamwork and building reliable systems.  
It inspires me to think about how games and applications we use every day are the result of such engineering practices.
